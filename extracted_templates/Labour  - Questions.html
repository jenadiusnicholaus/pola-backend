<span>1</span>
<span>. Is an employer required to provide a written employment contract to an employee?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Yes. According to </span>
<span>the Employment and Labour Relations Act, an employer is required to provide a written e</span>
<span>mployment contract at the commencement of the employment.</span>
<span> </span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>2. </span>
<span>What should I do if my employer refuses to give me an employment contract?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>It is your right to receive a writ</span>
<span>ten contract at the commencement of your </span>
<span>employment. If</span>
<span> you are employed, and</span>
<span> the employer refuses</span>
<span> to give you a written contract</span>
<span>, you can </span>
<span> file a case at the Commission for Mediation and Arbitration (CMA)</span>
<span> or other courts that deal with employment and labour relations</span>
<span>. </span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Note: </span>
<span>Not having a written contract does not mean you lose your legal rights.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>3. </span>
<span>How long can a short-term contract last according to the law?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>The law does not set a specific time limit, but a fixed-term contract should not be used for permanent jobs. Fixed-term contracts are meant for temporary or seasonal work.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>4. </span>
<span>Can an employee be terminated without a valid reason?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>No. According to </span>
<span> the Employment and Labour Relations Act, no employee should be terminated without a fair reason or without following a fair procedure.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>5. </span>
<span>What procedures must an employer follow before terminating an employee?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>A fair </span>
<span>investigation and </span>
<span>hearing must be conducted, where the employee is given an opportunity to respond to the allegations, and the decision must be made fairly.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>6. </span>
<span>Is it necessary to have written evidence when terminating employment?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Yes. A letter of termination should be provided, clearly stating the reasons, and there must be proof that the employee received the notice.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>7. </span>
<span>Can an employee claim compensation for unfair termination of contract?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Yes. An employee can</span>
<span> claim compensation of up to 24 </span>
<span>months of their last salary, along with any other outstanding entitlements such as leave, allowances, etc.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>8. </span>
<span>What is the difference between a permanent contract and a fixed-term contract?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>A permanent contract has no end date and continues until it is lawfully terminated. A fixed-term contract ends on the date or after the period that was agreed upon.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>9. </span>
<span>Is there a difference in rights between fixed-term and permanent contract employees?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Generally, all employees have equal rights under the law regarding working conditions, pay, and dignity at work, except in matters related to job security.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>10. </span>
<span>Can an employer change the terms of an employment contract without the employee's consent?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>No. Any changes to the terms of employment require agreement from both parties — the employer and the employee.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>11. </span>
<span>Can an employee leave work without giving notice?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Yes, but only in cases of serious breach of contract (constructive dismissal), such as when the working conditions are so poor that they negatively affect the employee’s well-being.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>12. </span>
<span>How long should the notice period for termination of employment be?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>It depends on the</span>
<span> type and</span>
<span> duration of employment:</span>
</p>
<p class="left">
<span></span>
<span>  </span>
<span>Seven (7) days</span>
<span> if the notice is given within the first month of employment.</span>
</p>
<p class="left">
<span></span>
<span>  </span>
<span>Four (4) days</span>
<span> if the employee is employed on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis.</span>
</p>
<p class="left">
<span></span>
<span>  </span>
<span>Twenty-eight (28) days</span>
<span> if the employee is employed on a monthly basis.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>13. </span>
<span>Is an employee entitled to annual leave?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Yes. An employee is entitled to not less than 28 days of leave per working year, including weekly rest days.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>14. </span>
<span>What other rights does an employee have under labour law?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Fair wages</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Maternity leave</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Sick leave</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Safe working environment</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Right to join trade unions</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>15. </span>
<span>How long does an employee have to file a claim regarding termination of employment?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>An employee must file the claim </span>
<span>at CMA (Commission for Mediation and Arbitration) </span>
<span>within 30 days after the termination of employment.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>16. </span>
<span>What steps do employment disputes go through before reaching the courts?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Employment disputes start at the Commission for Mediation and Arbitration (CMA). If no resolution is reached, the case may be taken to the Labour Court or the High Court, depending on the type of dispute.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>17</span>
<span>. What should I do if I am dismissed without a written contract?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>Having a written contract is not the only way to prove employment. The law also recognizes oral or implied contracts. If you are unfairly dismissed, you have the right to file a claim at the Commission for Mediation and Arbitration (CMA) within 30 days. Evidence such as pay slips, </span>
<span>attenda</span>
<span>ncy, </span>
<span>emails, text messages, or witness testimony can be used to prove the existence of the employment.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>18. </span>
<span>Does the absence of a written contract mean I have no rights as an employee?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>No. Employee rights do not depend solely on having a written contract. Once you start working under the employer’s direction and receive payment, you have a legally recognized employment relationship and are entitled to all rights provided under the Employment and Labour Relations Act.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>19. </span>
<span>What penalties can an employer face for failing to provide an employment contract to an employee?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>According to labour law, an employer who fails to provide a written employment contract is in violation of the law. They may be ordered by the Commission or Court to compensate the employee, pay a financial penalty, or issue a proper contract in accordance with guidelines from the Labour Department.</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>20. </span>
<span>Can an employer claim I have no rights because “we didn’t sign anything”?</span>
</p>
<p class="justify">
<span>No. </span>
<span>Although a written contract is emphasized, t</span>
<span>he law recognizes an employment relationship even without a written contract. If you worked for the employer, received a salary, and followed their instructions, that is enough proof of employment. You are still protected by the law and have the right to claim your entitlements.</span>
